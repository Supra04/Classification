Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

Machine Learning:  the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

Examples:
1. Web page ranking
2. Recognize humans and tag them
3. Similar movies to recommend users
4. Voice to Text
5. Spam detection
6. Optimize wind power generation
7. Computer vision in factories, to detect defects
8. Self driving cars
9. Fraud detection

AGI(Artifical General Intelligence): machines as intelligent as you or me.

Types of ML:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement Learning


Supervised Learning: you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from

Examples:
1. Spam filtering
2. Speech Recognition
3. Machine Translation
4. Online Advertising
5. Self-driving car
6. Visual Inspection

Types of Supervised Learning:
-Regression:  we're trying to predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers such as the house prices
-Classification: we're trying to predict only a small number of possible outputs or categories


Unsupervised Learning: data is not assigned to any specific label

Types of Unsupervised Learning:
-Clustering:
